# Login-System
A simple login system made in python. Runs in console. 
Uses input and output to get data and stores the username and password into a text document from which it can recall said data.

It is my first creation after learning the fundamentals of python. I intend to make more stuff with python. Might end up making something out of this in future.
Have Fun :D
